## Basic Project Documentation

1. Project Goal: 
   - The goal of the project is to develop a simple webpage that  can be found using a search engine, addresses any legal requirements that are relevant to our project, allows us to legally use Google Analytics to measure user behavior on the site, and passes w3c validation, Lighthouse, and GDPR Scanner.
2. Project Scope:
   - The scope of this project is for every theme, initiative, epic, story, and task to be tested and evaluated for effectiveness. This can be accomplished manually or with automated testing. The site will also abide by copyright laws.
3. User Stories:
   - Define user stories to capture the requirements from the end user's perspective, and prioritize them based on their importance to the user. They are defined here: [theme_breakdown.md](theme_breakdown.md) and should be completed in a single sprint and from the point of the user.

## Project Management Processes

1. Agile Methodology:
   - Use an agile methodology, such as Scrum, to manage the project. Define the sprints, create a backlog. This can be implemented in GitHub Projects workflow.
3. User Stories:
   - Define user stories and other important features, and prioritize them based on their importance to the user. Use the user stories to create the backlog.
4. Task Management:
   - Assign tasks to team members, define the task requirements, estimate the effort needed, and track the progress. Use GitHub Project Management. Team will communicate in person during class time and arranged meetings as neccessary, through discord, and with comments in GitHub.
5. Continuous Integration and Deployment:
   - Implement a continuous integration and deployment process to automate the testing and deployment of the website.
6. Quality Assurance:
   - Ensure that the website meets quality standards, such as W3C validation, Lighthouse, GDPR Scanner, and any other legal requirements. Test the website thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and is user-friendly and abides by copyright laws.
7. Documentation:
   - Peer review to create and resolve issues.
8. Feedback and Iteration:
   - Continuously gather feedback from the users, stakeholders, and team members, and use it to iterate and improve the website. Use A/B testing to validate new features and design changes.

By following these Lean and Agile project documentation and project management processes, the team can develop a simple webpage that delivers value to the end user, meets the project goals and requirements, and is continuously improved based on user feedback.
